# Array Generator
This program generates a nested array of random integers. The nested array consists of n sub-arrays with random lengths ranging from 1 to n. The values in each sub-array are also randomly generated and range from 1 to n.

## How to Use
1. Import the `random` module.
2. Call the `main()` function, passing in an integer value for `n`.
    
   `print(main(5))`
4. The function will return a nested array of `n` sub-arrays with random lengths and values.


## Example output:
`[[1, 3, 3], [2, 3], [1], [5, 5, 5, 5], [4, 4]]`

In this example, generates a nested array with 5 sub-arrays. The lengths of these sub-arrays are randomly generated and the values within them are also randomly generated. The final output is a nested array with sub-arrays of varying lengths and sorted in alternating order.
